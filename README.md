# Fake News Detection Website

## Overview

The aim of this project is to create a responsive website that employs a Machine Learning Model to predict the authenticity of news articles. In an age where information spreads rapidly, distinguishing between real news and fake news has become increasingly crucial. Fake news, characterized by baseless or intentionally misleading information presented as real news, poses a significant threat to both national security and financial stability. The proliferation of social media and the sharing of unverified information have contributed to the rapid dissemination of falsehoods and lies, leading to real-world consequences such as violence and misinformation.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Fake News Detection:** To develop and deploy a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting fake news articles. This model will analyze the content of news articles and assign a probability score indicating the likelihood of the news being fake.

2. **User-Friendly Website:** To create a user-friendly and responsive website where users can input news articles for analysis. The website should provide clear and easy-to-understand results, including the probability score and an explanation of the model's decision.

3. **Educational Outreach:** To raise awareness about the dangers of fake news and the importance of media literacy. The website can include educational resources and tips on how to critically evaluate news sources.

## Why Fake News Detection Matters

The spread of fake news is not just a matter of misinformation; it can have real-world consequences. It can incite violence, influence elections, damage reputations, and undermine trust in credible news sources. By detecting and combatting fake news, we contribute to a more informed and responsible society.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages the following technologies:

- Machine Learning (ML) for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Python for ML model development
- Flask for web application development
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for front-end development
- Responsive design for cross-device compatibility
